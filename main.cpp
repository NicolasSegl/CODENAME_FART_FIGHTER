// ctrl-f new, then clean up memory leaks

// maybe make a function and pass a parameter an enum that will tell what data to send/receive?
// change client init to see if the ip is already in

// send characters to clients. then simply update them (their position, namely)
// make more packets static. this may be faster?
// make separate folders for different Packet types (packet classes)
// make it so that, when a client disconnects, the server will remove the character from Client::serverCharacters
// the couts may be what is causing the lag on the server end. use mutexs to remedy this
// properly disconnect when the window closes
// make separate functions for every packet sent/received
// problems with lag when two exe's are launched, and not just one and the debugger
