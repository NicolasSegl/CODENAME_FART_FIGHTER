// maybe just a thread for every client for the server? so 5 clients connected to a server would result in the server using 5 threads to send the data
// ctrl-f new, then clean up memory leaks
// maybe make a function and pass a parameter an enum that will tell what data to send/receive?
// change client init to see if the ip is already in
// the couts may be what is causing the lag on the server end. use mutexs to remedy this

// make everything safe, check for failures
// when the client accepts a new character from the server, make sure that it doesn't already exist in the characterList
// make it so that the server can connect to itself with a client of its own
// clean more shit up. in the packet class, make an actual destructor

// BECOME COMMENT MAN. FUNCTIONS HAVE DESCRIPTIONS ABOVE THEM, THEIR PURPOSE. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
// RECEIVE PACKETS ON CLIENT ON ANOTHER THREAD
// beef rod hitboxes
// see client disconnect
// if you fall off pull em back up
// give vector structs += and -= operators
// check the +/- 5 in character collision
// basic menu
